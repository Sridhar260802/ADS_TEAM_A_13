Abstract
This project presents a novel approach for the detection of doctored images by
leveraging Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features. The LBP algorithm is employed
to extract discriminative texture patterns from images, offering a robust
representation for the identification of manipulated content. The project begins
with an extensive data collection phase, encompassing a diverse dataset
containing both authentic and manipulated images. LBP features are extracted
from this dataset, forming the basis for model training. The Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier is employed to learn the intricate patterns inherent in
manipulated images.
